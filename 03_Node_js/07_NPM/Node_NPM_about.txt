NPM --> stands for Node Package Manager
    --> it is a node tool used to install, uninstall or manage the third party packages.

check version:
    --> After installing nodejs successfully, write " npm --version " in terminal this will
        print the installed version of npm.
    --> This will also ensure that we have successfully installed node and npm.

Initialize npm:
    --> select the project folder where we want to initialize it.
    --> open "terminal" and execute the command " npm init " this will create 
        some file and dependencies folder in the selected folder.

Installing and uninstalling packages using NPM:
    INSTALLING:
    --> In terminal write " npm install <packages_name> " and press ENTER
        Example: npm install nodemon
        This will install "nodemon" package in selected folder.
    --> We can also write " npm i <packages_name> " to install the package no
        need to write "install", 'i' will also work the same.

    UNINSTALLING:
    --> In terminal write " npm uninstall <packages_name> " and press ENTER
        Example: npm uninstall nodemon
        This will uninstall the "nodemon" package from select folder.
    
Installing package as "devdependencies":
    --> devdependencies: this means we need package only when the project is in the development.
    --> Write " npm i <packages_name> --save-dev " this will install the package as devdependency.
    Example: npm install nodemon --save-dev

Installing package as "global":
    --> Write " npm i <packages_name> --global " this will install the package as a global.
        Example: npm i nodemon --global
        This means the any user can use the package in the same machine from anywhere.
