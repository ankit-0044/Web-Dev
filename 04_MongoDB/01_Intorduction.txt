SIMPLE INTRODUCTION OF MONGODB FOR MY REFERENCE

After successfully installing mongoDB, add its path to environment variable for terminal use.

START MONGOD:
    --> mongod is a mngodb's server process
    --> open terminal and enter the command "mongod" it will start the mongdb server process

USING MONGO:
    --> mongo is a mongdb's terminal where we can interact with database.
    --> open another terminal and enter command "mongo" it will start mongodb terminal(environment).
