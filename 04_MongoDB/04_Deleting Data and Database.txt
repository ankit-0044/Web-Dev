DELETING DATA AND DATABASE:

Delete Database:
    --> Select the database which we want to Delete using "use <database_name>" query.
    --> "db.dropDatabase()" query is used to Delete current database

Delete collection:
    --> Select the database in which we want to Delete the collection using "use <database_name>" query.
    --> "db.<collection_name>.drop()" query is used to delete the collection.
        Example: db.text.drop()

Delete Data From Collection:
    --> db.text.deleteOne({price:12000})
        This query will delete the maching document entry and will delete the first entry in case
        of multiple document match.

    --> db.text.deleteMany({price:12000})
        This will delete all the matching document in a single way.

NOTE: We can use all the conditions and operator during deletion like searching.
